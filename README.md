# Hospital-Management-System
A small hospital management system (in JAVA using OOP Concepts) for ‘Faisal Hospital.’ The hospital constitutes of multiple wards, namely Children’s Ward, Orthopedic Ward, and Surgical Ward. The wards are managed by different people, collectively called Staff. All members of the staff have a joining date and education. The staff may be medical or technical. Technicians and scrub techs are a part of the technical staff. Doctor and Nurses come under the medical staff. Each doctor has a docID and specialty. The medical staff also deals with patients and saves patient ids in their records. A patient can visit the doctor only once in a single day. If the patient exceeds this count, the system should output ‘&lt;Patient Name> with &lt;Patient ID> has already visited today.’ Otherwise, the program should output ‘&lt;Patient Name> with &lt;Patient ID> allowed.’ The hospital also maintains a record of each person to ever have entered the hospital. It keeps a record of the person’s name, birthdate and gender.
